            <p>My name is Rafael and I'm currently studying for a Computer Science Barchelor's degree at CESAR School.<br><br>
            Since I had contact with computers at a very young age, the digital world always captivated me with all the games and media available. As a result of that early contact, I grew up not really knowing what I would like to be when I get older, but what I did know was that I really wanted to work with something related to the cyber world.<br><br>
            That's when I discovered that two of my brothers were working with cyber security. I didn't really know what that meant at first, but when my father explained to me that they were "good hackers" and that companies would hire them to discover flaws in their sistems and correct them, I was really excited with the idea of working with that.<br><br>
            However, at the same time, the idea of making videogames and softwares always had the back of my mind and still is to this day. So, to make up my mind and understand better the technology I always used as a kid, I went to college to study Computer Science.<br><br>
            And well, all this story leads us to the present, where I'm still figuring out if I'll be a game developer, software developer or work with cyber security.
